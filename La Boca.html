            <section class="section0">La Boca have the rare, impressive ability to create designs and artwork resembling some of the best album sleeves lurking in your dad’s record collection.</section>

            <section class="section1">The studio, founded in 2002, is based in west London and has gathered an envious collection of awards, including Cannes Lions, European Design Awards, and the AOI Illustration Awards.</section>
                
            <section class="section2">Their exquisitely executed, psychedelic style is the combined result of each of the studio's members' unique influences, having hailed from London, Bordeaux, Devon and Switzerland. “We work as a studio, so most of our designs are created as a team,” says Scott Bendall of La Boca. “It's not unusual to have two or three people working on a single piece.”</section>
                
            <section class="section3">In their own words, La Boca’s creations are: “Retina teasing, tactile and occasionally slightly wonky.”</section>
